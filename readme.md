## Outside resources

## Packages

## Code style divergences
No code style divergences

## Notes for instructor
Finally got this up and running.  I really wanted to do stock charts and graphics. But not enough time. At least I got
the app to run and did CRUD operations. Lots of potentials for this to grow into something really nice, pretty and useful.
